# Project Proposal: Spring Boot Bookstore Management System

## Project Overview:

The Spring Boot Bookstore Management System is a robust and scalable application designed to manage the inventory and operations of a bookstore. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for bookstores to efficiently handle their book catalog, categorization, and sales operations.

## Objectives:

### Inventory Management:

- Develop a system for adding, updating, and deleting books in the inventory.
- Implement features to track book availability, quantity, and pricing.

### Category Organization:

- Categorize books based on genres, authors, or other relevant criteria.
- Enable the addition, modification, and deletion of book categories.

### Sales and Transactions:

- Implement a sales module to handle customer transactions.
- Provide features for generating invoices and tracking sales history.

### User Authentication:

- Implement a secure user authentication system for bookstore staff.
- Define roles and permissions to control access to different system features.

### Reporting and Analytics:

- Develop reporting functionalities for analyzing sales trends, popular genres, and inventory status.
- Provide insights through graphical representations and data visualization.

### Integration with External Services:

- Explore integrations with external services for features such as book recommendations or online purchases.

## Technical Details:

### Technology Stack:

- **Spring Boot:** Utilize the Spring Boot framework for rapid development and ease of configuration.
- **Database (e.g., MySQL):** Implement a database to store information about books, categories, and transactions.
- **Thymeleaf or React:** Choose a front-end technology for building a user-friendly interface.
- **Spring Security:** Implement Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.

### Modules:

1. **Book Management Module:**
   - CRUD operations for managing book details (title, author, price, quantity, etc.).
   - Integration with the database for persistent storage.

2. **Category Management Module:**
   - Functionality to add, edit, and delete book categories.
   - Association of books with relevant categories.

3. **Sales Module:**
